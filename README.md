# Pico-y-Placa
Technical exercise of "Pico y Placa" simulator for Stack Builders evaluation.

Using the language you feel most proficient in, we'd like you to write a "Pico y Placa" predictor.
The inputs should be a license plate number (the whole number, not the last digit. e.g., PBX-1234), a date (as a String), and a time.
Feel free to choose the date/time format you're comfortable with.
The program should return whether or not that car can be on the road.
You may use any input and output method you prefer.
